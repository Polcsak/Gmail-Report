## üß† How This Script Works

- Launches a local server via `flow.run_local_server(port=0)` to complete OAuth login  
- Fetches messages via Gmail API using `service.users().messages().list()` and `service.users().messages().get()`  
- Supports pagination using `nextPageToken`  
- Saves emails to `gmail_data.csv`

| Column Name         | Description                                                                 |

| `AttachCount`       | Number of attached files                                                    |

| `ToCount`           | Number of recipients in the `To` field                                      |
| `RecipientDomains`  | Email domains of all recipients in `To`, separated by `;`                   |
| `IsReply`           | Whether the subject starts with `Re:`                                       |
